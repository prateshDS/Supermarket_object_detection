# Supermarket_object_detection

1. Used Pretrained model for multiple object detection.
2. My model name (workplace/supermarket_object_training/models/tunned_ssd_resnet101_v1_fpn) derived from pre trained model (ssd_resnet101_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8)
3. Trained model on dataset(Packed objects which we see in malls)
4. Performed fine tunning.
5. The model took almost 3 hours to get trained.
6. Check results in sample_results folder.

Framework: TFOD 2 Object detection API
